Hello! This is an implementation of the A* Algorithm

There are two files here: the main file is used for rendering the algorithm, and the other one is for generating maps for the algorithm to navigate.
There are no dependacies for running the algorithm, but to create random generated maps I used perlin noise. To auto-make maps, you'll need to pip install perlin_noise.
